Whether you are a buyer or seller, there are a few key ways that you can use Zillow to your advantage.

First of all, buyers will need to learn the right way to search for homes. There are a couple of ways you can do this on Zillow.

You can search “Coming Soon” listings, which is where sellers go on the website to premarket their homes, or you could look at “Make Me Move” listings, which contains properties from potential sellers who are just thinking of selling later down the line. The third way you can search on Zillow is by looking at For Sale By Owner homes.

Many of these homes won’t be on the multiple listing service (or MLS), which is where most buyers find properties. This gives you a great chance to **get your foot in the door on homes that aren’t seeing the same level of competition you might experience elsewhere in the market.**

If you are a seller, you can use any of these tools to help get exposure on your home listing.

But, this isn’t the only great tool Zillow offers for sellers. You can also post a video walkthrough of your home onto the site. This will gain you additional interest on your home, give buyers a better idea of your home’s layout, and increase the quality of your listing’s marketing.

The third and final tip we have for you when using Zillow is to make use of the agent search feature.

Before working with any agent, you should be sure that this person is going to provide you with a high level of professional service. To help you get a better idea of what an agent is like in terms of performance, Zillow allows you to search for agents in your area.

On their profiles, you will find information about homes they’ve sold in the past, as well as other information about them. You can also see reviews from past clients who worked with those agents.
