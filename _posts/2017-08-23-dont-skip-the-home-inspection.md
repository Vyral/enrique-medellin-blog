Do you need to have a home inspection?

In my opinion, the answer is definitely yes. I even recommend that sellers order an inspection of their home before it hits the market. That way, you can address any issues up front and potential buyers know exactly what they’re getting into.

Not all sellers will do this, however, so **homebuyers should definitely order an inspection if one is not provided to them.** You don’t want to end up with any surprises after you’ve closed escrow and moved into the property.

Why are inspections so important?

Homes get worn down after years of wear and tear or deferred maintenance. You may not notice some of these issues just by looking at the home. There may be problems with the crawlspace, the foundation, or the roof. Just because a home looks perfectly staged and freshly painted doesn’t mean that there aren’t any problems hiding behind the walls.

You don’t want to move in and suddenly have to deal with a major plumbing leak or a crack in the foundation. Those kinds of issues can cause significant damage and be very expensive to repair.

I recommend that every homebuyer orders these three inspections:

1. **The general property inspection.** The inspector will check all of the mechanics of the home, including plumbing and the electrical system, and let you know if there are any red flags.

2. **The pest and/or termite inspection.** The inspector will look for any existing, active infestations, as well as conditions that could lead to future infestations. The inspector will then tell you how to resolve or prevent those infestations.

3. **The roof inspection.** The roof is a big ticket item, so it’s important that you get an assessment of how much longer the roof will last.

Based on the findings of those inspections, you can then determine whether you want to negotiate repairs with the seller or walk away from the deal. Make sure that you are comfortable with the amount of work or maintenance that needs to be done on the home before you purchase it.

If you have any other questions about home inspections or would like to learn more about buying a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
