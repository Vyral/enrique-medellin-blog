Our Santa Clara market is on fire in the second quarter, especially if you’re a seller.&nbsp;

Despite the fact that inventory has risen from 600 homes for sale back in December to roughly 1,200 at the current moment, it’s still near an all-time low. There’s a little bit more to choose from, **but we have just one month of available inventory right now.&nbsp;**

Our average sale price is $1,000,050, and homes are sitting on the market an average of 20 days before they go under contract. In some areas, it’s a lot quicker than that. Interest rates are in the low 4% range, which is another all-time low.&nbsp;

What do these numbers mean?

**If you’re a seller, it’s still a great time to enter the market.** If you price your home correctly, present it correctly, and market it properly, you can expect multiple offers, which can drive up your final sale price.&nbsp;

**If you’re a buyer, you’re going to have your work cut out for you.** I recently spoke to a fellow agent who received 19 offers on a listing of hers in San Jose, so it’s going to be tough to get your foot in the door against that level of competition.&nbsp;

You should be ready to pay significantly more than the asking price for a home and come in strong with your terms. I also encourage you to explore other options than what’s listed on the MLS, Redfin, or Trulia. There are a lot of other sales happening off-market such as ‘For Sale By Owner’ properties and those that are sold between agents.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about our market or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, feel free to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.&nbsp;
