Today I have Angel Orozco from [Skyline Security](http://www.skylinesecurity.com/) and he’s going to be talking about home security systems and how they can actually help your home sell in Silicon Valley.

Skyline Security has been around for fifteen years and they specialize in all of the newer and more advanced security systems. **Many of these are controlled via smartphones and they can be used commercially or residentially.**

**Technology is huge in security and Skyline offers fully automated technology.** Using your phone to set your alarm is extremely convenient, and you can even lock doors with their app. **You can secure your entire home from your phone.** Motion sensors can detect movement and they also have sensors to detect glass breaking.

We have just formed a partnership with Skyline Security and anyone who buys a home from us will get a free installation from Skyline Security. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to Angel.

We look forward to hearing from you!
